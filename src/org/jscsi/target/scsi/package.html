<body>
This package and its sub-packages contain all classes which represent SCSI byte
structures, elements consisting of one or more fields, which are used by SCSI
devices to exchange information.
<p/>
The class and member variable names in the sub-packages usually match those of
the represented SCSI elements and fields, respectively. This means that additional
information about the purpose and correct usage of these classes can be found
in either the <code>SCSI Architecture Model (SAM)</code> or one of the relevant
command standards (<code>SCSI PRIMARY COMMANDS (SPC)</code> and <code>SCSI BLOCK
COMMANDS (SBC)</code>), using the class name as a starting point.
<p/>
The following standards versions served as the basis for all classes
from this package (some optional functionality may have been omitted):
<ul>
 <li><code>SAM-5 Revision 5</code></li>
 <li><code>SPC-3 Revision 23</code></li>
 <li><code>SBC-3 Revision 25</code></li>
</ul>
